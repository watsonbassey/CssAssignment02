            <p>My name is <b>Watson Bassey</b>,</p>
            <p>From the enormous console television to the thin LED’s of today, from the huge brick-like mobile phones
                of 1990’s to the sleek and stylish smartphones we fancy, my generation had a front position to witness
                the era of technological revolution. At a young age, all these technological developments captivated and
                kept me ruminating. With a puzzled expression on the face, I would always question my father and seek
                knowledge on their design and principle of working. <i>With this developed my love for technology</i>.

                <i>Margin</i> property is used to define the space around elements. It clears an area around the
                element.

            <p>
                <i>Border</i> property is used to set the border on an element. The CSS border properties
                <b>(border-style, border-color,
                    border-width and border-radius)</b> are used to specify the style, color and size of the border of
                an
                element.
